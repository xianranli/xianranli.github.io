Laura Tibbs-Cortes is a ORISE Postdoctoral Fellow studying phenotypic plasticity of crop performance and how it is affected by climate. She earned a B.A. in Biology from Benedictine College in Atchison, Kansas in 2017, then came to Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa as an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. Dr. Tibbs-Cortes completed her PhD from ISU in Genetics and Genomics with a minor in Statistics in Fall 2022. Her dissertation research focused on identifying genetic and environmental factors underlying nutritional and agronomic traits in maize. In addition, she has conducted research on the microbiome of tardigrades. In her research, she enjoys integrating multiple types of big, “omic” data (genome, transcriptome, envirome, microbiome, etc.) to understand biological questions from a whole system approach.
